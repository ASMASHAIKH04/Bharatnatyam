## Bharatanatyam Pose Classification

This project implements a deep learning model to classify Bharatanatyam dance poses using TensorFlow and Keras. The workflow includes:

- **Data Preparation:** Loads and preprocesses images from Google Drive, organizing them into training and validation datasets with data augmentation.
- **Model Architecture:** Builds a convolutional neural network (CNN) with layers for convolution, pooling, dropout, and dense connections.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Trains the model on the dataset, visualizes training and validation accuracy/loss, and evaluates its performance on test images.
- **Prediction Visualization:** Loads test images, makes predictions, and visualizes the results with confidence scores.

**Key Libraries Used:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL.
